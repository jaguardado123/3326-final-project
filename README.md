# Final Project

## Let's get started!

Codespaces doesn't support GUI applications by default, so we will be using desktop-lite. **Desktop-lite** is a lightweight desktop for our Codespace container that can be accessed through the web.

To view our lightweight desktop simply follow the steps below.

### 1. Find Port 6080

Open a new terminal in your Codespace and click on the **Ports** tab to find port 6080. Contact the instructor if you do not see this port.

### 2. Make Port 6080 Public

Next, right-click on port number 6080, select **Visibility** and change it to **Public**.

Once you open the forwarding address url in your browser you will see the screen below. Go ahead and click on **Connect**.

### 5. You're All Set!

You should now see the following screen. This is the desktop for your Codespace, so any GUI apps you run on VS Code will appear here.
